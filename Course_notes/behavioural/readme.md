**CUSTOMER OBSESSION**

Tell me about a time when you predicted your customer’s needs?

- **Customer having trouble configuring the project** - created utility saveld lot of time, SOC approval and validations 

- **KMS key download feature difficult to understand** - Faqs, also created scripts and python utility to be downloaded form SAP cutomer marketplace

Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult customer?

- **customer which, they were not giving time we were not getting time for configuration, worked with team in germeny to schedule calls in early morning**

Tell me about a time when you helped customer? 

- **Customers was not seeing anything on dashboard** (wrong configuration onboarded) - Customer was furstrated in a way that product was not working, had asked my PM's to scedule a quick call. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**OWNERSHIP** (When something went wrong, other's job or beyond responsibility)

- Example when you failed at work? 

- **SDC india project deadline was given**, I did underestimaate the work and forgot some minor details before giveing the deadline. Actually parrlerly we were woking on rolling out new design architecture. In the breifing meeting accepted that I missed that detail.

- tell me about time when you personally showed ownership?

- **Limited time for the testing before the rollout** to customer environment.  Me being in PST time I extended my hours and completed some of their rsposnibility and updated them on result. Did few samll PR's in hotfix for the dev team as well. QA team was able to validatethe realease and it wsa on tim.

- **GKnowledge sharing sessions fro the PM team** and have seen PM's designing fetures not compatible with the architecture

  **improving accuracy of our VPN detection algorithm**

- Tell me about a time when you decided to sacrifice short-term gain for long term-success for your company?

- **Data classification feature, as a service, new design and utility was not scalable and it was monolithic design ought to fail**

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**INVENT AND SIMPLIFY**

Tell me about a time when you had a challenging situation in which you had to find an alternative approach.

**Customer integration with classification API's were slow, simply created task queue and went serverless**

Tell me about a time when you found a simple solution to a difficult problem?

**data classification algorithm, added support for multiple file formats, made it secure (data maangement layer)** added few API endpoints*

**VPN detection algorithm improvement added more data points**

**Deployment process simplified, managment of resources** - added charts, created central repos, backup strategy in case of bastion hosts goes down

**Recently started working on video's explaining features to customer, document is good but have seen customer missing small details**


---------------------------------------------------------------------


**ARE RIGHT A LOT** (Good instinct but not always right)

Tell me about a time when you made a bad decision?

- **SDC india project deadline was given**, I did underestimaate the work and forgot some minor details before giveing the deadline. Actually parrlerly we were woking on rolling out new design architecture. In the breifing meeting accepted that I missed that detail.

- I was wrong
**Azure permission model, feature designed on AD sync, wrong interpretetion of model, tho the feature was working it could have been broken so got feedback accepted upadted feture**

- manager wrong (difficult decision)
**Customer data deleivery process was wrong**
*Disgreed on the customer data deleivery opetions after POC completion with manager, some practices were agaist SOC audit and security guidliance.*

Tell me about a time when you did not have enough data to make the right decision.?

**Recently We saw slowness in the system during customer call, looking at the node network and CPU usage I was partly sure that something is wrong with inventory configuration**
- did not have enough time as customer was not able to use the product. So cannot quickly check so I asked with the judgement to provide their configiration details and yes that was the issue. It could have been memory leak due to some other customer's configuration.

**LEARN AND BE CURIOUS**

Tell me something interesting you've learned recently? 

**VPN DETECTION ALGORITHM and Strategies, out of tech but started learning ice skating as well**

Describe a time when you were challenged to think differently in order to find a better solution to a problem? 

**Data Classification over the data pipeline, still ongoing**

____________________________________________________________

**Hire and Develop the Best**

Tell me about a time when you coached someone? 

**We have three rotations every six months all the devs are hired under me**

How do you help your employees to grow?

**By giving them enough space to learn and explore, allow them to choose the path and giving them right resources to learn**

**We have appriciation policy internally, also whenever there is something great done I try to acknowledge and make sure of their growth**

______________________________________________________________

**Insist on the Highest Standards**

Tell me about a time when you relentlessly worked on improving the quality of a fully working product, service or process? 

**Worked on improving ops practices (automated deployments, secrets managment and access managment)**

Tell me about a time when you refused to compromise your standards?

**Customer data deleivery after customer offboarding**

**Highest starndard when deleivering the inventory sysnc feature/  with proper load testing to deliver near perfect product**

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**THINK BIG** (never ending ideas | amazon go) (Leaders here never accept that our vision is big enough, innovative enough, or that we have high enough standards.)

Tell me about a time when you took on a big risk, because you focused on long term thinking? 

**Information extractor as a service and multiple use cases, including scalling and the data pipeline**

Tell me about a time when you successfully pitched an idea to global stakeholders? 

**VPN detection accuracy**
**Secure Key download process** Multilayer security public/private key

____________________________________________________________________)


**BIAS FOR ACTIONS (get things done)** (where we can’t possibly know the right answer. Option A or Option B? Pick and move on.)


Tell me about a time you had to quickly adjust your work priorities to meet changing demands? 

**It's kind of everyday recently as the product is going live with customers with customers being frist priority all the dev work assign low priority but try to finish withn deadline**

Tell me about a time when you were working on a tough deadline and you did not have the time to consider all options?

**Secure Import feature | support was provided for minumu keys and length | made sure the feature is extensible**

How did you decide between the two technologies?

**We did do comparison of using Go and Python but we were not coming upto eventual conclusion and wasting more time was not an option and majority of devs were familiar with python we went with it**

______________________________________________________________________

**Frugality** (Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.) (inventing to solve problems in a cheaper way. Which often is faster, easier to maintain, easier to extend)

Tell me about a time when you requested additional resources for a project? 


**Never had to do that fortunately but in terms of technologies, I try to go with the chepest and open source free to use licence so that do not reinvent the wheel**

How do you make tradeoffs between quality and costs?

**I always try to consider cost is primary consideration, by selecting opensource and most efficient way to do things and not compromising quality**

Tell me about a time when you had a complex problem that required a lot of in-depth analysis? 

- **Customers inventory syncing was an issue, initially thought that it's configuration issue, eventually went to clusters chscked node performance it was crashing and restarting, previous restrt logs and realized that it was using 101% memory it's psossible on kubernetesh adn birng crashed, read the code and there we required major changes**


Tell me about a time when you had to investigate a challenge in your team?

------------------------------------
**DELEIVER RESULT**
- Time you faced difficult time at work

**customer gave bad feedback on the product**
1) *S* Our first POC customer, end of the licence we got average feed back with not all positive comments 2) *T* We had a final meeting with customer so prepared a quetsion list on features, what went wrong and whot would they like to improve. 3) *A* Noted all the responses and most of the design or feature changes I took it during the ongoing sprint with additional work, asked my PM's if they can extend the lisence. *R* deleived all the result

Tell me about a time when you, as a manager, have set a challenging goal in a project or initiative?

**We needed to release a feature for notification userstory, we new we can't integarte it in all parts so we integrated notification services in highly used fetures of aour product**
