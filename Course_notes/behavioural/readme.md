**CUSTOMER OBSESSION**
*Utility permission validation, eventhub validation etc*
1) *S* Customer having problems with project configuration *T* Provied customer with some sort of utility *A* Created utility, got SAP SOC approval and security validation published *R* Customers, Teams and OPS

*KMS download feature understanding*
2) *S* KMS key download feature customers were having trouble understanding *T* Some sort of way to make customer understand the design *R* Recorded video, created steps and Faq documentation, also created scripts supporting multiple environment *R* customer was ablet to do it without any further questions

*Customer configuring wrong subscription*
3) *S* Customer recently started having issues with slow performance and no activity *T* We knew as it was POC and multi tenant system something must be wrong with DB's and scaling. *A* I had customer on my side on the phone, went through the steps they are performing, debugged with live session and figured out that the subscription onborded was wrong *R* Happy

**OWNERSHIP** (When something went wrong, other's job or beyond responsibility)
- Example when you failed at work? 

*Sales team requiremt on SDC india for campaign*
1)  *S* Short time to finish the project, and was pretty confident on completing, I worked on it and totally forgot while giving the deadline that we are redesigning the architecture so the deployment process will change and might take longer *R* I was able to deleiver product but was running on old version. In the breifieng I accepted that I missed some details and should have considered before giving deadline. 

*QA testing*
1) *S* QA team had limited time before the actual deadline of the new version upgrade as it was delayed in dev testing 2) *A* I had to work on other deployment and upgrade but at the same time was afraid that the dev team in UK time will not have enough time to solve if something is found 3)  *T* Disd all the QA teating until the UK team and india team was there forwarded my rsults bugs so can be fixed, possible small PR. 4) We had fixes and release was on time,


**INVENT AND SIMPLIFY**

*VPN detection algorithm improvement*

*Deployment process simplified, managment of resources*

*Added FAQ pages for all the new features within the product instead of having JAM page*


**ARE RIGHT A LOT** (Good instinct but not always right)

- I was wrong
*Azure permission model, feature designed on AD sync, wrong interpretetion of model, tho the feature was working it could have been broken so got feedback accepted upadted feture*

- manager wrong
*Disgreed on the customer data deleivery opetions after POC completion with manager, some practices were agaist SOC audit and security guidliance.*

**DELEIVER RESULT**
- Time you faced difficult time at work

*bad feedback on the product*
1) *S* Our first POC customer, end of the licence we got average feed back with not all positive comments 2) *T* We had a final meeting with customer so prepared a quetsion list on features, what went wrong and whot would they like to improve. 3) *A* Noted all the responses and most of the design or feature changes I took it during the ongoing sprint with additional work, asked my PM's if they can extend the lisence. *R* deleived all the result

*VPN blocking service*

**BACHBONE,  DISAGREE AND COMMIT** (if something is worng challenge it in a constructive and professional manner)
- Disagreement at work

*AWS inventory sync feature design*
1) *S* feature was designed where horizontal scaling can be limitation and containers could have crashed 2) *T* I had a discussion with owner of that feature and found certain loopholes and why it is not great design 3) *A* Did not want to agree on that the stitation can break the flow, hence created a load testing on the specific feature and documented how it is not even useful touse it without hirarchy 4) *R* Agreed and we enhanced the feature


**THINK BIG**

**BIAS FOR ACTIONS (get things done)**
