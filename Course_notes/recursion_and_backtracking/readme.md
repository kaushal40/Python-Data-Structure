**BACKTRACKING TECHNIQUES**
- All recursive functions should have the following: 
1. Base Case, 
2. Working towards a base case,  (recursive step should take you closer to base case)
3. Recursive step.
- For each function call, recursion uses space on the programâ€™s stack memory. So, be aware of space complexity. It is easy to assume that recursion takes O(1) memory. In reality, it might be taking more on the function stack.

- o(logN) so if the numbers are 16 you should be able to complate task in 4 steps squarroot(16) = 4 `O(log 16)`
